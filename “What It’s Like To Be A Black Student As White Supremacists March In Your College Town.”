Former president of UVa’s Black Student Alliance Wes Gobar writes a corrective to the idea that gained footing after A12 that the wave of white supremacist violence was an isolated incident. Using local history (from critiquing Thomas Jefferson to contextualizing the police violence against Martese Johnson) and personal experience, Gobar outlines the realities of racism and surveillance in Charlottesville and offers ideas for change.
