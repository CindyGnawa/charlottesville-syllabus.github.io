Wellmon confronts the the inability of UVa to itself confront -- and name -- the white supremacy that marched on its Lawn. For Wellmon, this inability is inherent to “the University” as an institution, because the University is structured to uphold “epistemic values” (like critical inquiry and open argument) alone, and not more substantive values of “the good” or justice. As constituent parts of that University, we are accordingly better served engaging our fellow community members -- both within and outside of the University -- to advance the substantive value of opposing white supremacy, rather than engaging a University administration that by definition “lack[s] the language and moral imagination” to do the same.
