By exploring the history of and analogy between confederate statues and Native American statuary (a comparison ushered in by A12), Moore highlights the towns that are considering the negative impact of their Native American statues, which by and large celebrate the narratives of the oppressors of Native Americans. While Moore does not reference them explicitly, Charlottesville has two such statues: one of Merriwether Lewis and William Clark standing in front of a cowering Sacajawea at the intersection of Main and Ridge Streets, and one of George Rogers Clark seated atop his horse and surrounded by Native American people crouched and standing on foot, at the corner of University and JPA.
