Community eyewitness accounts of the counter-protests that refute Trump’s lies of a violent “alt-left” that “came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs.” Instead, Antifa activists protected unarmed clergy and racial justice protesters from armed phalanxes of white supremacists — Cornel West even claimed afterward that they saved his life. Most of recollections compiled are of clergy who participated alongside West in an interfaith non-violent direct action to block the Park’s entrance from white supremacists.
