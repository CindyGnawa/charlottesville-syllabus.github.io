Newman describes Charlottesville as “the most aggressively segregated place [he’s] ever lived in or visited,” and sources that aggression in 1) racial profiling by local police and 2) cultural appropriation in the city’s businesses, and C’ville Weekly’s racist depictions of black people. His incisive piece is meant to re-route critiques from Spencer and Lee Park to “this town’s progressives assuming its race problem has nothing to do with them.
