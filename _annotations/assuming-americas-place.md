Dorr’s article describes the work, teachings, and mentorship of UVa Biology Professor and Dean of the College Ivey Lewis, who created one of the most well-known eugenics research programs in the country in the first half of the twentieth century. Lewis continued to advise students in the field long after these theories had fallen into disrepute. Dorr argues eugenics gave “educated, self-consciously modern Virginians” a means to continue justifying Jim Crow with a scientific gloss. Eugenics was a bridge between the archaisms of the Old South and the “progressive” scientism of the day a means to uphold white supremacy while still “ushering in modern liberal-industrial society in one motion.”
