UVA student activist Ian Ware gives his eyewitness account of events of the weekend. He discusses the importance of grappling with Thomas Jefferson and the legacy of white supremacy at UVA and in Charlottesville more generally, noting that although neo-Nazis arenâ€™t a constant presence, the need to dismantle systemic white supremacy in Charlottesville and UVA remains. Ware also notes the lack of police action despite their heavy numbers, even compared to the KKK rally the month before.
