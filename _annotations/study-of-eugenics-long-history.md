Outlines the prominence of eugenics research and curricula at UVa, stemming from (first UVa president) Edwin Aldermanâ€™s commitment to what was considered a standard science in the first half of the 20th century. It also addresses the continued legacy at UVa, including buildings and noteworthy scholarships still named for eugenicists, as well as contextualizes UVa within the nationwide acceptance of eugenics during the same period.
