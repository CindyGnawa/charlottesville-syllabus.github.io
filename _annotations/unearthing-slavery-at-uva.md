In light of the archaeological discovery of another slave burial site on Grounds in 2013, this article examines the history of slavery at University of Virginia through the lens of its memorialization initiated by University community members. Wolfe’s article rests on the premise articulated by then-second year College undergraduate Jordan Jackson: “slaves built this university and they deserve to have something tangible.”
