Walker refutes the claim that many white folks have made that the violence of August 12 “is not what Charlottesville is about.” He recounts the ways his own life has been impacted by ongoing and pervasive racism in Charlottesville, and argues for the political import of existing as what he calls a “black and happy heathen” in the face of the city’s structural racism.
