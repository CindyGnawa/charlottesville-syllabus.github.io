With maps, diagrams, design sketches, and photographs, architect Kenneth Schwartz identifies the causes of American cities’ physical and economic decline, using Charlottesville, and especially the Vinegar Hill neighborhood, as an exemplary case study. See also the site’s extensive bibliography, which lists resources on Charlottesville’s history, urban design, and cultural geography.
