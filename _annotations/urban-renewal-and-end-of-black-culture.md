In this book, Saunders and Shackelford interview former denizens of Vinegar Hill who lived in Charlottesville before, during and/or after urban renewal razed the once-thriving black community as part of a federally funded redevelopment project. The people interviewed varied in experience and perspective — from businessmen to cooks and from supporters of the redevelopment to those who decried its adverse effect on black life in Charlottesville.
