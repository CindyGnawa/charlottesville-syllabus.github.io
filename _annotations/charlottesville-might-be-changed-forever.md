This article documents the experiences of student activists who participated in the counter-demonstrations held on August 11 and 12, ranging from terror at the “monstrous hatred” of the torchlit march and fear in the chaos of the vehicular terrorist attack on Fourth and Water St. to catharsis facing white supremacy head-on at Emancipation Park. The article particularly addresses the emotional impact of these events on the students as they prepare to begin the fall semester at UVa.
