Fiction and nonfiction writer, activist, and former UVa MFA student Emma Eisenberg’s extensively detailed investigative piece into the 2012 disappearance of Charlottesville-local black trans woman Sage Smith. Eisenberg focuses on the ways that Smith was failed by local systems of government and policing because of the entrenchment in these systems of antiblackness and lack of care for poor and trans populations in town.
