University of Virginia students recount what they saw and experienced on August 11th and 12th. These interviews detail the violence students saw downtown on August 12, moments of community solidarity and care, feelings about University administration’s response to the white supremacist march on the Lawn, and evolving opinions about the “alt-right” and the best ways to confront white supremacy.
