Written by a former UVa PhD student in the history department who worked with Professor Scot French and the Center for the Study of Local Knowledge at the Carter G. Woodson Institute. This essay-length article examines the life and education, broadly defined, of William Gibbons, a prominent black Charlottesville community member. Nesbit’s essay focuses on three periods of Gibbons’ life: “as a slave in Albemarle County and at the University of Virginia; as a minister to Charlottesville’s African American Baptist community during the transition from slavery to freedom; and as the leader of one of Washington D.C.’s largest Baptist churches from 1868 to his death in 1886.”
