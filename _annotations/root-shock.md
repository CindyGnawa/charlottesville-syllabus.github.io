Using several case studies from the second half of the twentieth century, Fullilove shows how the negative effects of urban renewal fall disproportionately on black communities and lead to dispossession, financial loss, psychological trauma, the fracturing of social organizations, and the collapse of political action. Furthermore, she argues that de-urbanization policies ask us to consider how to manage “progress” in the context of democracy — what are the consequences when a government supports one group’s progress at the expense of another’s?
