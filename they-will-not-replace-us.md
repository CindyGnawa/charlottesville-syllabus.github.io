Legal reporter and Charlottesville resident Dahlia Lithwick argues that the white-supremacist slogan, “You will not replace us,” is factually bankrupt. While that slogan is expressly intended to intimidate and terrorize, it in fact symbolizes an unfulfillable nostalgia for a time when white, straight-identifying men could claim complete domination over public and private space. That time, for Lithwick, has decisively ended. Not that white supremacy and heteropatriarchy have ended. But instead, such ideologies can now be decisively opposed by precisely the folks they seek to dominate. Those who espouse such ideologies, for Lithwick, have indeed been “replaced.”
