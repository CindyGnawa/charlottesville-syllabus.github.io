The decades after the Civil War were the greatest era of monument-building in American history. The statues installed in public spaces throughout the country constitute a kind of public memory of the national past that reifies white supremacy within the civic landscape. The book's introduction and a chapter entitled, "Slavery's Memorial" are particularly useful reading on the topic of confederate statues an their installation.
